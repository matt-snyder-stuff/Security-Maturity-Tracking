# Security Maturity Project Overview

Welcome to the **Security Maturity Project Tracking Matrix** GitHub page! This project aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the organization's security maturity across various domains, helping stakeholders monitor, plan, and enhance security capabilities over time.

## Overall Program Status

The **Overall Program Status** provides a high-level view of the maturity levels across all security domains. This status is represented using a scoring system that tracks progress from **Initial** to **Leading** levels for each capability.

### Overall Status Table Example
| **Capability**           | **Current Maturity Level** | **Target Maturity Level** | **Progress**       |
|--------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------|
| SIEM Capability          | Stage 2 - Procedural       | Stage 4 - Leading         | In Progress (50%)   |
| SOAR Capability            | Stage 1 - Minimal          | Stage 3 - Innovative      | At Risk (30%)       |
| SOC Operations, Response, and Threat Hunting    | Stage 2 - Procedural       | Stage 4 - Leading         | On Track (60%)      |
| Log Collection      | Stage 1 - Innovative       | Stage 4 - Leading         | On Track (75%)      |
| Threat Intelligence     | Stage 2 - Innovative       | Stage 4 - Leading         | At Risk (45%)      |
| Insider Risk     | Stage 0 - Innovative       | Stage 2 - Leading         | In Progress (65%)      |
| Team     | Stage 2 - Innovative       | Stage 4 - Leading         | On Track (55%)      |
| Compliance/Audit Reddiness      | Stage 1 - Innovative       | Stage 3 - Leading         | In Progress (75%)      |

This table shows the current maturity levels, target goals, and the progress for each capability to help track the overall development of the security program.

## Individual Aspects of the Program

The **Security Maturity Project Tracking Matrix** also provides insights into the individual aspects of the program, breaking down the work into specific capabilities and sub-items over time.

### Example: SIEM Maturity - Year 1

| **Month**   | **Capability**           | **Sub-Item**              | **Description**                                      |
|-------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| January     | SIEM Monitoring          | Initial Implementation    | Deploying basic SIEM monitoring for threat detection |
| February    | Log Collection Expansion | Critical Assets Logging   | Expand log collection to include critical assets     |
| March       | Alerting Configuration   | Correlation Alerts        | Create correlation rules for suspicious activities   |
| April       | Data Normalization       | Data Model Setup          | Implement a data model for consistent analysis       |

This monthly breakdown provides a detailed plan to improve each security capability step-by-step throughout the year.

## Conclusion
The **Security Maturity Project Tracking Matrix** is an essential tool for monitoring, planning, and improving security capabilities over time. By visualizing progress, stakeholders can easily understand the current status and make informed decisions to allocate resources effectively.
