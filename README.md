# Security Maturity Project Overview

Welcome to the **Security Maturity Tracking Project** GitHub page! This project aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the organization's security maturity across various domains, helping stakeholders monitor, plan, and enhance security capabilities over time.


## Program Overview

The **Program Overview** provides a high-level view of the maturity levels across all security domains. This status is represented using a scoring system that tracks progress from **Initial** to **Leading** levels for each capability.

### Overall Status Table Example
| **Capability**           | **Current Maturity Level** | **Target Maturity Level** | **Progress**       |
|--------------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------|
| SIEM Capability          | Stage 2 - Procedural       | Stage 4 - Leading         | In Progress (50%)   |
| SOAR Capability          | Stage 1 - Minimal          | Stage 3 - Innovative      | At Risk (30%)       |
| SOC Operations, Response, and Threat Hunting | Stage 2 - Procedural | Stage 4 - Leading         | On Track (60%)      |
| Log Collection           | Stage 1 - Innovative       | Stage 4 - Leading         | On Track (75%)      |
| Threat Intelligence      | Stage 2 - Innovative       | Stage 4 - Leading         | At Risk (45%)       |
| Insider Risk             | Stage 0 - Innovative       | Stage 2 - Leading         | In Progress (65%)   |
| Team                     | Stage 2 - Innovative       | Stage 4 - Leading         | On Track (55%)      |
| Compliance/Audit Readiness | Stage 1 - Innovative     | Stage 3 - Leading         | In Progress (75%)   |

This table shows the current maturity levels, target goals, and the progress for each capability to help track the overall development of the security program.

## Individual Aspects of the Program

The **Security Maturity Tracking Project** also provides insights into the individual aspects of the program, breaking down the work into specific capabilities and sub-items over time.

### Example: SIEM Maturity - Year 1

| **Month**   | **Capability**           | **Sub-Item**              | **Description**                                      |
|-------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| January     | SIEM Monitoring          | Initial Implementation    | Deploying basic SIEM monitoring for threat detection |
| February    | Log Collection Expansion | Critical Assets Logging   | Expand log collection to include critical assets     |
| March       | Alerting Configuration   | Correlation Alerts        | Create correlation rules for suspicious activities   |
| April       | Data Normalization       | Data Model Setup          | Implement a data model for consistent analysis       |

This monthly breakdown provides a detailed plan to improve each security capability step-by-step throughout the year.

## Tools for Evaluating Security Capabilities

### Tool Usage
The evaluation tools included in the **Security Maturity Tracking Project** are designed to help users systematically assess security technologies. These tools provide structured frameworks and criteria for evaluating each domain, enabling users to identify strengths, weaknesses, and areas for improvement efficiently.

The **Security Maturity Tracking Project** also includes tools to help evaluate various security technologies, including:

- **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)**
- **Email Security**
- **Network Security**
- **EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) Tools**

These evaluation tools assist in assessing the maturity and effectiveness of each technology, identifying gaps, and planning improvements.

## Conclusion

The **Security Maturity Tracking Project** is an essential tool for helping your organization mature its security capabilities, streamline processes, and achieve your security goals effectively. By providing tools to evaluate technologies such as **SIEM**, **Email Security**, **Network Security**, and **EDR**, this matrix enables you to systematically assess and enhance each domain, identify gaps, and create targeted improvement plans.

With visual progress tracking and structured evaluations, stakeholders can easily understand the current status and make informed decisions, ensuring that your security posture evolves in alignment with your organization's needs.
